Summary
=======
    Demonstrate Object Oriented Design by creating a list of objects of different types.

Constraints
===========
    - Code must be written in C++.
    - No third party libraries may be used (e.g.: Boost, Microsoft Runtime Library, etc.).
    - Use only the C++ standard libraries (including STL).

Files Provided
==============
    main.cpp: example test code
    Kennel.h: object used to add animals to a kennel (feel free to add members as needed)

Files Expected
==============
    Any files needed for implementation

Details
=======
    Provide the implementation of Kennel so that:
    - the method AddCat() adds a Cat to the Kennel, providing its name.
    - the method AddDog() adds a Dog to the Kennel, providing its name.
    - the method RollCall() prints the Animals name and sound to std out:
        - Cats identify themselves by printing "Meow" to std out.
        - Dogs identify themselves by printing "Woof" to std out.
