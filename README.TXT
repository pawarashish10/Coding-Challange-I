Summary
=======
    A series of programming tasks are provided (and described below).  Each task lives in its own subdirectory and contains its own README.TXT file with instructions.

Programming Tasks
=================
    abbr: [C] Create an abbreviated version of a string given a dictionary.
    binary_file: [C or C++] Parse a binary file and output a text summary.
    object_oriented_design: [C++] Demonstrate Object Oriented Design by creating a list of objects of different types.

Notes
=====
    - Demonstrate your understanding of the language (the tasks are small in scope but the solutions should be able to scale to more complex ones).
    - Demonstrate your understanding of the langauge's standard library (don't reinvent the wheel).
    - Code will be judged on: correctness, scalability, readability, proper abstraction, etc.
    - It's OK to use the internet for basic research and reference.
    - Don't post any part of the tasks online.
    - Do the work yourself.
    - The tasks are not intentionally made to be "trick questions", if there is any confusion or ambiguity clearly document any assumptions you make.
    - Good luck.
